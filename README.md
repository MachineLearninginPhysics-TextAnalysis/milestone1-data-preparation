# milestone1-data-preparation
This repository gathers tools and files needed for extraction text data from Twitter, building corpora and representing documents in various representations. Some basic transformations (models like TF-IDF, LSI, LDA, etc.) would be briefly implemented here.

We use machine learning to analyze the text of Twitter tweets, to categorize them. The language we use is Python, and our research is directly related to concepts such as data collection, BOW, NLP, topic recognition, etc. The first goal is to categorize and analyze the tweets supervisory, and the second goal is to do these for unsupervised format. To read the report, you can use 'Main_Report.pdf'. To understand some good information for each file, read the extended description in front of each file. Also, the order of the files is as follows: Downloading_and_init_processing.ipynb, tags.csv, tweet_information.csv, most_words_list_result.csv, most_words_list_result: By Group, Advanced_processing.ipynb, word_to_binary.csv, data_clean.csv, data_clean_sample_100.csv.
